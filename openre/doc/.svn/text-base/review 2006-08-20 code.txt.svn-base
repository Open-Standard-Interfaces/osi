Copyright was asjusted slightly and checked on all documents for consistency. Copyright date was adjusted on old

Sample Common Library Review
----------------------------

Summary:

The major change suggested is replacement of common platform dependent code with a common library. For this,
the boost library is under consideration. Another concern is the 

Possibly some functionality can be moved to other libraries such as REUtil or REWrapper in order to reduce
code duplication - especially if the boost libraries are added. However, this needs to be carefully considered since
we don't really want to make REUtil or REWrapper too general. The libraries should remain as atomic as possible.

Perhaps apply a namespace (e.g. ReSampleCommon)
